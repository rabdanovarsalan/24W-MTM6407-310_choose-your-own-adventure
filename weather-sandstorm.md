Sandstorm wrecks martian expeditions
------------------------------------

A huge sandstorm has engulfed the planet in an instant. Mars rover has reportedly been ejected into open space, while connection to other martian motor vehicles has been severed.


Amidst the swirling sea of red dust, the colossal sandstorm swept across the Martian landscape with an unforgiving ferocity, shrouding the entire planet in an otherworldly haze. The once serene and barren surface became a chaotic maelstrom of fine particles, whipped up by the powerful gusts of wind. In the midst of this extraterrestrial tempest, reports started trickling in, sending shockwaves through the mission control centers on Earth.
