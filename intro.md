Stars aligned, and you've gained the ability to influence meteorological phenomena of Mars, the fourth planet planet of our Solar System.
What kind of weather your will demands to take place on the Red Planet? 

As the Martian dust devils twirled in response to my celestial whims, a mysterious resonance permeated the atmosphere, awakening an ancient power dormant beneath the planet's surface. Unbeknownst to me, the weather manipulation had not only captivated the attention of the forgotten rover but also triggered a series of dormant Martian artifacts.
